# DATA11001 Introduction to Data Science Project

**Google Trends and COVID: Predictions and Correlation**

Welcome to the "Google Trends and COVID" project â€” an exploration of how Google search behavior correlates with COVID-19 case trends. The goal was to evaluate whether search volume data could serve as an early indicator for rising case numbers. This project was developed as part of the **DATA11001: Introduction to Data Science** course at the **University of Helsinki**.

### Project Highlights

- Correlated Google Trends keywords with COVID-19 case data using time-lag analysis  
- Identified the most predictive search terms through feature selection  
- Built and evaluated a machine learning model to forecast case trends  
- Transitioned from daily to weekly data for improved signal quality and prediction accuracy

### Tools & Libraries

- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebooks**  
- **pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**, **pytrends**  
- Data sources: *Google Trends*, *Our World in Data*
